# Claude Code Usage Monitor

![Screenshot](.github/animation.gif)

A lightweight Windows desktop app for people already using Claude Code, with optional Codex and Google Antigravity usage display.

It shows how much of your Claude Code, Codex, and/or Antigravity usage window you have left, without needing to open the terminal or the provider site.

## What You Get

- A **5h** bar for your current 5-hour Claude usage window
- A **7d** bar for your current 7-day window
- Optional Codex usage bars alongside Claude Code
- Optional Antigravity model usage bars for Google's 5-hour and weekly Gemini quota windows
- A live countdown until each limit resets
- A small native window with a normal title bar that you can move anywhere and that remembers where you left it
- A **Settings** menu (also available by right-clicking the window) for refresh, displayed models, and refresh interval

## Who This Is For

This app is for Windows users who already have **Claude Code (CLI or App) installed and signed in**.

Codex support is optional. To show Codex usage, install and sign in to the Codex CLI, then enable Codex from the **Settings › Models** menu.

Antigravity support is optional too. To show Antigravity usage, install and sign in to Google Antigravity, then enable the **Antigravity** model from the **Settings › Models** menu.

It works best if you want a simple "how close am I to the limit?" display.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Claude Code (CLI or App) installed and authenticated
- Optional: Codex CLI installed and authenticated, if you want Codex usage
- Optional: Google Antigravity installed and authenticated, if you want Antigravity usage

If you use Claude Code through WSL, that is supported too. The monitor can read your Claude Code credentials from Windows or from your WSL environment.

## Install

Install the latest version from WinGet:

```powershell
winget install CodeZeno.ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor
```

If you prefer not to use WinGet, you can still download the latest `claude-code-usage-monitor.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/releases) page and run it directly.

## Use

After installing with WinGet, run:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor
```

A normal application window opens, with an entry on the Windows taskbar.

- Move it like any other window; its position is restored the next time you start it
- Use the **Settings** menu, or right-click anywhere in the window, for refresh, displayed models, update frequency, and exit
- Closing the window exits the app; starting it again while it is already running just brings the existing window to the front
- To launch it automatically when you sign in, add it yourself in Windows Settings › Apps › Startup, or drop a shortcut into the Startup folder (`shell:startup`)

### Models

Use the **Settings › Models** menu to choose what the window displays:

- **Claude Code** is enabled by default
- **Codex** can be enabled alongside Claude Code or shown by itself
- **Antigravity** can be enabled alongside the other providers or shown by itself as its own model column

When multiple models are shown, each model has its own usage bar and matching usage text color, and the window resizes to fit them. Antigravity prefers Google's Gemini quota summary when available and falls back to model quota data when needed.

## Diagnostics

If you need to troubleshoot startup or visibility issues, run:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --diagnose
```

This writes a log file to:

```text
%TEMP%\claude-code-usage-monitor.log
```

Settings are saved to:

```text
%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json
```

## Account Support

This app works with the same account types that Claude Code itself supports.

As of **March 19, 2026**, Anthropic's Claude Code setup documentation says:

- **Supported:** Pro, Max, Teams, Enterprise, and Console accounts
- **Not supported:** the free Claude.ai plan

If Anthropic changes Claude Code availability in the future, this app should follow whatever Claude Code supports, as long as the usage data remains exposed through the same authenticated endpoints.

## Privacy And Security

This project is **open source**, so you can inspect exactly what it does.

What the app reads:

- Your local Claude Code OAuth credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
- If needed, the same credentials file inside an installed WSL distro
- If Codex is enabled, your local Codex credentials from `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` or `~/.codex/auth.json`
- If Antigravity is enabled, your local Antigravity OAuth token from Windows Credential Manager target `gemini:antigravity`

What the app sends over the network:

- Requests to Anthropic's Claude endpoints to read your usage and rate-limit information
- Requests to ChatGPT's Codex usage endpoint to read your Codex usage and rate-limit information, if Codex is enabled
- Requests to Google's Cloud Code / Antigravity endpoints to read your Antigravity quota information, if Antigravity is enabled
- Nothing else: the app has no update check and never contacts GitHub at runtime
- If proxy environment variables such as `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` are set, those outbound requests use that proxy, and `NO_PROXY` can exempt individual hosts

What the app stores locally:

- Window position
- Polling frequency
- Displayed model preferences

What it does **not** do:

- It does not send your credentials to any other server
- It does not use a separate backend service
- It does not collect analytics or telemetry
- It does not upload your project files
- It does not directly edit your Codex credentials file
- It does not update or modify itself; to move to a newer version, install it again

Notes:

- If your Claude Code token is expired, the app may ask the local Claude CLI to refresh it in the background
- If your Codex token is expired, the app may ask the local Codex CLI to refresh it in the background. The monitor does not write `auth.json` itself; any credential update is handled by the Codex CLI.
- If your Antigravity token is expired, open Antigravity and sign in again. The monitor does not write Windows Credential Manager entries itself.
- Proxies should be trusted because proxied usage requests include your OAuth bearer token inside the TLS connection

## How It Works

The monitor:

1. Finds your enabled model login credentials
2. Reads your current usage from Anthropic, ChatGPT, and/or Google's Antigravity endpoints
3. Shows the result in its own window
4. Refreshes periodically in the background

If the newer usage endpoint is unavailable, it can fall back to reading the rate-limit headers returned by Claude's Messages API.
